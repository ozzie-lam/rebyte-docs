# Agent API

The Agent API allows you to build AI agent within your own applications. It provides a set of APIs to interact with the agent, such as sending messages, uploading files, and creating threads.

## Overview

A typical integration of the Agent API has the following flow:

1. Create an Agent on rebyte Agent editor by defining its custom actions, such as `Model`, `Data`, `Tools`, `Control Flow`, etc. Pick the model and parameters that you want to use.

2. Create a Thread when a user starts a conversation.

3. Add Messages to the Thread as the user asks questions.

4. Run the Agent on the Thread to generate a response.

## Step by step

1. Create an Agent.

Here, we'll just use this ["Chat with GPT3.5 agent"](https://rebyte.ai/p/21b2295005587a5375d8/callable/f4222f209267e5b24cda/editor) as an example. Remember to test your agent first and make sure it works as expected. Also, click "Deploy" to make it available for the API.

2. Create a thread

Before using the API, get your API key from the API console on the sidebar. You should use this key to authenticate your requests.


When creating a thread, you can append the messages to the thread when creating it.
You can also attach metadata to the thread. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format.


```shell
curl 'https://rebyte.ai/api/sdk/threads' \
--H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--H 'Authorization: Bearer $REBYTE_KEY' \
--H 'Cookie: NEXT_LOCALE=en' \
--d '{
     "metadata": {
        "user": "abc123"
      },
    "messages":[
        {
            "role":"user",
            "content":"Hi, how are you?"
        },
        {
            "role":"asistant",
            "content":"Hi, I am good. What about you? Is there anything I can help?"
        }
    ]
}'
```

In the response, you will find the thread id. You can use this thread id to add messages to the thread and run the agent on the thread.

* Example Response 
  
```shell
{
    "id": "UHSHhnkWGElWShQS5ZtOa",
    "created_at": 1714050659
}
```

1. Add messages to the thread

```shell
curl 'https://rebyte.ai/api/sdk/threads/{thread_id}/messages' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $REBYTE_KEY" \
  -d '{
      "role": "user",
      "content": "How does AI work? Explain it in simple terms."
    }'
```

In the response, you can see the message information.

* Example Response

```shell
{
    "id": "u8YmkrO4lYZD8r8Nl5cFh",
    "created_at": 1714051597,
    "thread_id": "UHSHhnkWGElWShQS5ZtOa",
    "role": "user",
    "content": "Teach me how to make pancake."
}
```

3. Run the agent on the thread

In order to run the agent on the thread, you should get the url from deploying your agent and make a request to this url.

```shell
curl -L https://rebyte.ai/api/sdk/p/21b2295005587a5375d8/a/f4222f209267e5b24cda/r \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $REBYTE_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
    "version": 1,\
    "config": {
        "MODEL_CALL": {
            "provider_id": "openai",
            "model_id": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106",
            "use_cache": true,
            "use_stream": false,
            "seed": null,
            "response_format": null
        }
    },
    "thread_id":"UHSHhnkWGElWShQS5ZtOa",
    "blocking": true,\
    "inputs": []
    }'
```

* When calling the agent, you should specify the thread id, and you will be able to get all the messages and metadata from the thread.

* You can also use "contentOnly:true" to get only the content of the messages.


4. Get the messages from the thread

```shell
curl 'https://rebyte.ai/api/sdk/threads/{thread_id}/messages'     \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $REBYTE_KEY" \
```

In the response, you will get the list of all messages on the thread.

* Example Response

```shell
{
    "list": [
        {
            "id": "u8YmkrO4lYZD8r8Nl5cFh",
            "created_at": 1714051597,
            "thread_id": "UHSHhnkWGElWShQS5ZtOa",
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Teach me how to make pancake."
        },
        {

            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, often referred to as a cryptocurrency. It was created in 2009 by an unknown person using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.
