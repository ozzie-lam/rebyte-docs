# Language Model Completion

We provide `Language Model Completion` action to let the language model complete your prompt.

## Usage

* Add a `Language Model Completion` action to your agent.
* Configure the action with specifications and parameters.

### Specification

**Prompt**

* This is the prompt that will be sent to the model.
* The model will complete your prompt and respond with the completed content.

### Configuration

The configuration is the same as [Language Model Chat](language-model-chat.md).

You can choose the model you want to use by clicking the model's name, the default model is "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106".

&#x20;

There are five settings in the configuration panel, as shown below.

**Temperature**

* "Temperature" controls the randomness of the model's output.
* The higher the model temperature, the more random the output is.

**Maximum Output Tokens**

* "Maximum Output tokens" specifies the maximum number of tokens to generate.
* Can use up to 40,000 tokens(the limit for models vary), including prompt and model returned content.

**JSON Response**

* "JSON Response" button enable JSON mode, which guarantees the messages the model generate are in JSON format.
* NOTE: This feature is a beta feature and only supported by OpenAI's "gpt-4-1106-preview" model now.
* NOTE: When you use this feature, make sure the word "JSON" is in the context. Otherwise, the OpenAI's API will throw an error.

**Seed**

* The "Seeds" is a parameter that can be specified when using the `Language Model Completion` and `Language Model Completion` actions.
* It helps to ensure consistent outputs by making the system sample deterministically, resulting in the same result for repeated requests with the same seed and parameters.
* NOTE: This feature is a beta feature and only supported by OpenAI's model.

**Stop Words**

* Stop words are used to make the model stop at a desired point, such as the end of a sentence or a list.

On the top right of the action, there are two more things to configure: "Stream Mode" and "Cache Mode".

**Stream**

* This option allows you to receive partial chat responses as they are being generated, rather than waiting for the entire completion to be finished before receiving a response.
* By setting stream mode, you can start processing or displaying the beginning of the chat before the full response is received.

**Cache**

* Caching involves storing frequently accessed data to improve response times without making repeated calls to a model.
* If you use the cache mode, the model will cache the response and return the cached response when the same request is made again. This will make your agent run faster.

### Message Format

Rebyte uses a similar message format as OpenAI. The message format is a JSON object with the following fields:

* Role: could be one from 'user', 'system', or 'assistant'.
* Content: content of this message.
* Name(optional): name of role.
* Context(optional): context of this message.
