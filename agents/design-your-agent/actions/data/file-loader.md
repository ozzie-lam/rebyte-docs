# File Loader

The `File Loader` action can load files previously uploaded to Rebyte either via the Rebyte UI or via API.

A typical use case is you want your agent to process a file uploaded by a user. You can use the `File Loader` action to load the file and extract data from it.

This Action accepts a `file_id` as input and returns the extracted data from the file. 'file_id' is a unique identifier of the file uploaded to Rebyte.


We support various data types, including: DOC, DOCX, IMG, EPUB, JPEG, JPG, PNG, XLS, XLSX, PPT, PPTX, MD, TXT, RTF, MD, TXT, RTF, RST, PDF, JSON, HTML and EML.

## Usage

* Add a `File Loader` action to your agent and select the file you want to upload to your agent.

* Specify the `file_id` of this file and use this unique `file_id` whenever you want to refer to this file.

* If you connect your agent to an app, app users can upload files in the app, and the `file_id` will be passed to the agent.

* The output of this action is in JSON format, containing extracted data from the file. 

<!-- **Config**

* **File ID:** UUID of the file, can be fixed or reference to a variable.

**Output**

* JSON Array of structure data extracted from the file
* Depends on file type, structure data can be different. For example, for a PDF file, the structure data is a list of pages, each page is a list of paragraphs, each paragraph is a list of lines, each line is a list of words. For a JSON file, the structure data is the JSON object itself. -->
