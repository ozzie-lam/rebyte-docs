# Quick Start

We will show you how to build a grammar agent in 5 minutes.

## Step 1: Create an Agent

* Navigate to the "My Agents" tab in the sidebar and then click on "Create Agent".

* Describe what you want to do with this agent and choose the right template for your agent.

* Click the "Generate Agent Template" button and we will generate a basic template for you to build from. 

* You can change the name, description and visibility of the agent and add tags for more information. Or you can simply regenerate the template if you don't like the current one.

* Click the "Create Agent" and you will have your own agent in just a few seconds.

## Step 2: Design Your Agent

* In the auto-generated template, we have already created some actions for you. 

* To build a simple agent like our grammar checker, there's no need to add more actions. For more complex agents, you can add actions by clicking the plus button between different actions.

* Write the instructions more the model in the editor, describing what you want the model to do.

## Step 3: Test Your Agent

* Click the "Datasets" tab on the top, then click "Create Datasets". 

* Fill in the name and description of your dataset.

* Since this is a chatbot, the testing dataset will be in the form of a (list of) json object representing a conversation.

* After you've created the dataset, go back to the "Design" panel and choose the new dataset as the input.

* Click "Run Testcases" to test your agent with the dataset.

* The results will be shown below each action. See if the output is what you want. If not, change the settings of your agent and try again.

## Step 4: Deploy the Agent

* Click "Deploy Agent" on the top right, then click "Deploy A New Version". 

* You can use your agent on your ReByte app or integrate it into your own app using the code we provide.
